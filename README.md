# Object-Detection-and-Segmentation-with-TorchVision

For this tutorial, we will be finetuning a pre-trained Mask R-CNN model in the Penn-Fudan Database for Pedestrian Detection and Segmentation. It contains 170 images with 345 instances of pedestrians, and we will use it to illustrate how to use the new features in torchvision in order to train an instance segmentation model on a custom dataset.
